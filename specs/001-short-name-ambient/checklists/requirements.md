  - **Status**: PASS - All 28 functional requirements have specific, measurable criteria
  - **Evidence**:
    - FR-001: "request latency (p50, p95, p99 percentiles), request throughput (requests per second)"
    - FR-010: "load initial page and render health summary in under 2 seconds (p90)"
    - FR-022: "comply with WCAG 2.2 Level AA accessibility standards"

- [x] Success criteria are measurable
  - **Status**: PASS - All success criteria include specific metrics
  - **Evidence**:
    - Time-to-Insight: "90% of users... in under 30 seconds"
    - Issue Diagnosis Speed: "45 minutes to under 15 minutes (67% reduction)"
    - Page Load Performance: "90th percentile... under 2 seconds"
    - Feature Usage: "60% of model deployments... within 24 hours"

- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic
  - **Status**: PASS - Focused on user outcomes, not implementation details
  - **Evidence**: No mention of React, API response times, database queries, or framework-specific metrics
  - **Examples**: "Users can assess model health in 30 seconds" not "API responds in 200ms"

- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
  - **Status**: PASS - 6 primary acceptance scenarios with Given/When/Then format
  - **Evidence**: Lines 27-38 in spec.md cover all major user flows

- [x] Edge cases are identified
  - **Status**: PASS - 5 edge cases documented with expected behaviors
  - **Evidence**: Lines 42-46 cover data unavailability, missing instrumentation, service outages, performance degradation, concurrent access

- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
  - **Status**: PASS - Extensive "Out of Scope" section
  - **Evidence**: 10 feature exclusions + 4 technical exclusions clearly documented (lines 319-354)

- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified
  - **Status**: PASS - Comprehensive Dependencies and Assumptions sections
  - **Evidence**:
    - 3 external platform dependencies, 3 internal dependencies, 5 team dependencies
    - 18 assumptions across technical, user, data, and organizational categories

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
  - **Status**: PASS - 28 FRs organized into 6 categories with specific criteria
  - **Evidence**: Each FR includes measurable capability (e.g., "MUST display", "MUST allow", "MUST comply")

- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
  - **Status**: PASS - ML Operations Engineer persona with complete troubleshooting workflow
  - **Evidence**: Primary User Story covers diagnosis journey from alert to resolution

- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
  - **Status**: PASS - Requirements align with 15-minute time-to-insight goal
  - **Evidence**: Auto-refresh (FR-008), time range selection (FR-006), comprehensive metrics display (FR-001, FR-002) all support rapid diagnosis

- [x] No implementation details leak into specification
  - **Status**: PASS - Architecture decisions documented as prerequisites only
  - **Evidence**: Perses and Prometheus mentioned as required services, not implementation approach

## Validation Summary

### Overall Status: **READY FOR CLARIFICATION**

### Passing Criteria: 14/15 (93%)

### Blocking Item:
- **3 Clarification Questions Remain**: User must provide answers before proceeding to planning phase

### Strengths:
1. Comprehensive requirements with 28 testable FRs organized into logical categories
2. Measurable, technology-agnostic success criteria aligned with user outcomes
3. Extensive risk analysis with mitigation strategies and ownership
4. Clear scope boundaries with detailed "Out of Scope" section
5. Strong accessibility requirements (WCAG 2.2 Level AA)
6. Well-defined user journey with ML Ops Engineer persona
7. Graceful degradation strategy for optional dependencies (TrustyAI)

### Areas of Excellence:
- **Success Criteria**: Exceptionally well-defined with specific percentages, time targets, and baseline comparisons
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Thoughtful handling of data unavailability, service outages, and performance scenarios
- **Multi-Agent Input**: Specification synthesizes insights from Product, UX, Engineering, and Management perspectives
- **Dependencies & Risks**: Comprehensive identification with clear ownership and mitigation strategies

### Recommended Next Actions:

1. **Immediate**: User responds to 3 clarification questions (Q1: Backend support, Q2: Data retention, Q3: Update frequency)
2. **After Clarifications**: Update spec.md with user's selected answers
3. **Re-validate**: Confirm all checklist items pass
4. **Proceed to Planning**: Run `/speckit.plan` to create implementation plan

### Notes:

- The 3 clarification questions adhere to the guideline maximum (3) and focus on high-impact decisions:
  - Q1 affects architecture (multi-backend support = 4-6 weeks additional dev time)
  - Q2 affects feature scope (30-day vs 7-day historical views)
  - Q3 affects complexity (real-time streaming vs polling)
- All clarifications have reasonable default suggestions (Option C in each case provides balanced approach)
- Specification demonstrates excellent collaboration across Parker (PM), Aria (UX), Stella (Staff Eng), Emma (EM)
