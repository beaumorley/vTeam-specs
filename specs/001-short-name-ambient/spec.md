# Feature Specification: Enhanced Model Metrics Display

**Feature Branch**: `001-short-name-ambient`
**Created**: 2025-10-24
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "This RFE is around improving the metrics displayed on the Deployed Models Details page. Today, these metrics are displayed in a tab called Endpoint Performance. This RFE will focus on improving the metrics based on customer feedback around displaying both performance and behavior related metrics as well as leveraging Perses for visualization."

---

## âš¡ Quick Summary

Enhance the Deployed Models Details page to display comprehensive metrics including both performance and behavior-related data, replacing the current "Endpoint Performance" tab with an improved visualization experience powered by Perses.

---

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

**As an ML Operations Engineer**, I need to quickly assess the health of my deployed models so I can identify and resolve production issues before they impact business outcomes.

**Current Pain**: When I get alerted about a model issue, I have to navigate through multiple tools and tabs to determine whether the problem is performance-related (latency, errors) or behavior-related (data drift, prediction patterns). This typically takes 45-60 minutes to diagnose.

**Desired Outcome**: I can view a single, comprehensive metrics dashboard that shows me both performance and behavior metrics in one place, allowing me to diagnose issues in under 15 minutes.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am viewing the Deployed Models Details page, **When** I navigate to the metrics section, **Then** I see an overview of model health including both performance metrics (latency, throughput, errors) and behavior metrics (request patterns, prediction distributions)

2. **Given** I need to investigate a model performance issue, **When** I select a time range (1 hour, 24 hours, 7 days, or 30 days), **Then** all metric visualizations update to show data for that time period

3. **Given** I am monitoring model health, **When** the page is open, **Then** metrics automatically refresh every 1 minute to show current data

4. **Given** I want to understand model behavior trends, **When** I view the metrics dashboard, **Then** I can see prediction patterns, request volume trends, and data quality indicators alongside performance metrics

5. **Given** I need to share metrics with my team, **When** I view specific metrics, **Then** I can export the visible data to CSV format for reporting

6. **Given** I am a user with accessibility needs, **When** I navigate the metrics page, **Then** I can access all functionality via keyboard and screen reader with WCAG 2.2 Level AA compliance

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when historical metrics data is unavailable?** System displays a message indicating data retention limits and shows available time range
- **How does the system handle models without behavior metrics instrumentation?** Behavior metrics sections show an informative empty state with setup instructions for enabling TrustyAI
- **What happens when Prometheus is temporarily unavailable?** Error state with retry option is displayed; auto-refresh pauses until service recovers
- **How does the page perform with high-volume models?** Query performance may degrade; system implements query result caching and progressive loading to maintain responsiveness
- **What happens when multiple users view the same model metrics simultaneously?** Each user receives independent data views; shared Prometheus backend handles concurrent query load

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

---

## Technical Prerequisites *(mandatory)*

The following infrastructure and services must be available for this feature to function:

### Required Services

- **Prometheus Metrics Backend**: Prometheus instance with minimum 30-day retention configured for model serving metrics

- **Model Serving Instrumentation**: KServe or ModelMesh platform instrumented with per-model request metrics following OpenMetrics format

- **Kubernetes Metrics Pipeline**: Pod resource metrics (CPU, memory, GPU) available via Prometheus

- **RBAC Integration**: Authentication and authorization system for multi-tenant metric query isolation

- **Perses Visualization Library**: Perses framework compatible with React/PatternFly applications and suitable for production embedding

### Optional Services

- **TrustyAI Service**: External service providing behavior metrics (bias detection, fairness metrics, data drift indicators). Feature gracefully degrades if unavailable.

---

## Assumptions *(mandatory)*

### Technical Assumptions

- **Prometheus as Metrics Backend**: Architecture assumes Prometheus as the primary metrics store; other backends would require significant rework

- **Perses Production Readiness**: Perses visualization library is stable and mature enough for production use with adequate performance characteristics

- **Metric Query Performance**: PromQL queries against model-specific metrics complete in under 500 milliseconds for typical model cardinality

- **Network Latency**: Network latency between console frontend and Prometheus backend is under 100 milliseconds

- **Standardized Metrics**: All deployed models emit standardized metrics following KServe/ModelMesh contracts with consistent naming and labels

- **Modern Browser Support**: Users access the system with modern browsers supporting ES6+ JavaScript (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge current version - 1)

### User Assumptions

- **Primary Use Case**: Users primarily need monitoring and troubleshooting capabilities, not compliance reporting or deep ML analysis

- **Technical Proficiency**: Users understand basic machine learning concepts (precision, recall, latency, drift, bias)

- **Desktop-First Usage**: Primary usage occurs on laptop/desktop displays (1280px width minimum); mobile is secondary

- **Single-Model Focus**: Phase 1 focuses on individual model metrics viewing, not multi-model portfolio comparison

- **Language Support**: Initial implementation supports English language only; internationalization (i18n) planned for future phases

### Data Assumptions

- **Historical Data Retention**: Prometheus retains high-resolution metrics data for 30 days minimum

- **Metrics Freshness**: New metric data points available within 30 seconds of emission from model serving platform

- **Metrics Consistency**: Metric naming conventions and label structures remain consistent across different model serving runtimes

- **TrustyAI Optional**: Core monitoring functionality works without TrustyAI; fairness and bias metrics are additive enhancements

### Organizational Assumptions

- **RBAC Alignment**: Users with model view permissions can view all metrics for that model; no fine-grained metric-level permissions in Phase 1

- **Alert System Separation**: Alert rule configuration handled by existing OpenShift alerting infrastructure; Phase 1 links to external alert configuration

- **Standard Metrics Only**: Phase 1 supports only predefined platform-provided metrics, not user-defined custom metrics

- **Prometheus Cardinality Budget**: Platform team has allocated sufficient Prometheus cardinality budget for per-model metrics at expected scale

---

## Dependencies *(mandatory)*

### External Platform Dependencies

- **Perses Project**: Depends on Perses CNCF project for visualization components; requires version compatibility validation and production readiness assessment

- **Prometheus**: Depends on Prometheus availability, query API stability, and configured retention policies

- **TrustyAI (Optional)**: Depends on TrustyAI service for behavior metrics; requires API contract stability and graceful degradation design

### Internal Platform Dependencies

- **OpenShift AI Console Framework**: Depends on PatternFly component library version alignment and console navigation patterns

- **Model Serving Infrastructure**: Depends on KServe/ModelMesh metrics emission standards and deployment event tracking

- **Historical Data Export/Archive**: Long-term metric warehousing beyond Prometheus retention is not supported; CSV export limited to currently visible time range

- **Perses Dashboard Persistence**: Saving custom dashboard layouts or user preferences is not supported; only URL state persistence for time range and filters

- **Metric Correlation Analysis**: Automated correlation detection or root cause analysis is not provided; users manually correlate metrics by viewing multiple panels

- **Multi-Model Comparison**: Comparing metrics across multiple models is not supported in Phase 1; focus is on single-model detailed view

- **Custom Time Range Selection**: Users cannot specify arbitrary time ranges; limited to preset options (1h, 24h, 7d, 30d)

- **Advanced Filtering**: Complex metric filtering beyond basic time range selection is not supported in Phase 1

- **Mobile Optimization**: Mobile-responsive design is not prioritized; focus is desktop experience (1280px+ width)

- **Real-time Streaming**: Metrics update via polling (1-minute intervals), not real-time streaming connections

### Technical Exclusions

- **Multi-Backend Support**: Only Prometheus backend is supported; integration with other metric stores (Grafana, Datadog, custom) is out of scope

- **Query Result Caching**: While query caching may be implemented for performance, user-facing cache management is not exposed

- **GPU Metrics Deep Dive**: Basic GPU utilization is included if available, but detailed GPU profiling and analysis is deferred

- **Cost Analysis**: Displaying infrastructure costs or cost optimization recommendations is not included

## Technical Risks *(mandatory)*

### High Severity Risks

**Risk: Perses Embedding Not Production-Ready**
- **Description**: Perses may not be mature enough for production embedding in React/PatternFly applications
- **Impact**: Could require complete visualization strategy change, delaying delivery by 2-4 weeks
- **Mitigation**: Conduct 2-day proof-of-concept in Sprint 1 to validate Perses embedding feasibility; define clear acceptance criteria; prepare fallback plan using alternative charting libraries
- **Owner**: Technical Lead
- **Status**: Must be resolved in first sprint

**Risk: Behavior Metrics Don't Exist**
- **Description**: Drift detection, prediction distribution, and other behavior metrics may not be collected today
- **Impact**: Invalidates entire "Model Quality" section of design; major scope reduction required
- **Mitigation**: Validate metric availability early with Platform Team; clearly separate TrustyAI-dependent features with feature flags; design graceful degradation UX; document TrustyAI as optional prerequisite
- **Owner**: Platform Team + Technical Lead
- **Status**: Requires immediate investigation

**Risk: Query Performance at Scale**
- **Description**: High-cardinality models (1000s requests/sec) may cause slow Prometheus queries, especially with multiple concurrent panels
- **Impact**: Poor user experience, backend overload, potential service degradation
- **Mitigation**: Implement query result caching (30-60 second TTL); use progressive loading (fetch visible panels first); add rate limiting on auto-refresh with backoff; work with Platform Team on Prometheus capacity planning and recording rules; conduct load testing before launch
- **Owner**: Platform Team + Backend Engineer
- **Status**: Requires capacity planning and load testing

### Medium Severity Risks

**Risk: PatternFly + Perses Visual Integration**
- **Description**: Perses default styling may not match PatternFly design system
- **Impact**: Visual inconsistency, potential maintenance burden with custom CSS
- **Mitigation**: UX Design reviews Perses default styling early; define acceptable customization boundaries; document CSS overrides for maintainability
- **Owner**: UX Designer + Frontend Lead
- **Status**: Review required during design phase

**Risk: Accessibility Implementation Underestimated**
- **Description**: WCAG 2.2 Level AA compliance effort may be underestimated
- **Impact**: Rework required, delayed launch, potential compliance issues
- **Mitigation**: Include 15-20% accessibility overhead in all estimates; conduct early accessibility audit (mid-sprint); engage accessibility SME for design review before implementation; define accessibility acceptance criteria for every story
- **Owner**: Engineering Manager + Accessibility SME
- **Status**: Build into all estimates

**Risk: TrustyAI API Changes**
- **Description**: TrustyAI API may evolve during development, breaking integration
- **Impact**: Rework of fairness metrics integration, potential delays

**Risk: Team Context Switching**
- **Description**: Team members pulled to other priorities reducing focus and velocity
- **Impact**: Reduced velocity, quality issues, extended delivery time
- **Mitigation**: Negotiate protected sprint capacity (minimum 70% allocation); limit work-in-progress to 1-2 stories per developer; build 20% buffer into timeline; escalate context-switching issues immediately to stakeholders
- **Owner**: Engineering Manager
- **Status**: Ongoing management required

---

## Phase 1 Constraints *(mandatory)*

Phase 1 implementation operates under the following constraints:

### Functional Constraints

- **Display Only**: Read-only view of existing Prometheus metrics; no write operations or metric configuration

- **Predefined Metrics Only**: Only platform-provided, predefined metrics are displayed; custom metric support deferred to Phase 2

- **No Alert Creation**: Links to external alert configuration only; no embedded alert rule creation or editing

- **Limited Historical Range**: Historical data viewing subject to Prometheus retention policy (target: 30 days)

- **Synchronous Queries**: Direct PromQL queries to Prometheus; no background aggregation, pre-computation, or dedicated metric store

### Technical Constraints

- **Single Backend**: Prometheus only; no multi-backend abstraction layer

- **Polling-Based Refresh**: 1-minute polling interval; no WebSocket or streaming connections

- **No Caching Layer**: Query results may be cached briefly (30-60 seconds) but no persistent caching infrastructure

- **Desktop-First**: Responsive design targets 1280px+ displays; mobile experience is secondary

### Performance Constraints

- **Query Limits**: Individual queries must complete within 5 seconds or fail gracefully

- **Concurrent Load**: System designed for 50 concurrent users; higher load may require infrastructure scaling

- **Data Resolution**: Metric resolution depends on Prometheus scrape interval (typically 15-30 seconds); no higher resolution available

---

## Clarification Questions

The following areas require clarification before implementation planning:

### Question 1: Data Source Integration and Backend Support

**Context**: The feature assumes Prometheus as the metrics backend (FR-007, Technical Prerequisites), but customer environments may vary.

**What we need to know**: What is the current metrics backend infrastructure in target deployment environments?

**Suggested Answers**:

| Option | Answer | Implications |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| A      | Prometheus is standard and deployed in all target environments | Simplest path: proceed with Prometheus-only implementation as specified |
| B      | Multiple backends exist (Prometheus, Grafana, custom) and we need multi-backend support | Significant complexity: adds 4-6 weeks development time, requires abstraction layer, but unlocks broader adoption |
| C      | Some customers use Prometheus, others use different backends | Phase 1 targets Prometheus-only customers; Phase 2 adds multi-backend based on demand data |
| Custom | Provide specific backend information | Please specify which metrics backends are in use and their prevalence |

**Your choice**: _[Awaiting user response]_

### Question 2: Historical Data Retention Requirements

**Context**: FR-009 specifies 30-day historical data retention, and Emma's analysis notes enterprise customers expect minimum 30 days for compliance/audit (FR-009, Assumptions section).

**What we need to know**: What is the actual Prometheus retention policy in target environments, and what time ranges are business-critical?

**Suggested Answers**:

| Option | Answer | Implications |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| A      | Prometheus retention is configured for 30+ days in all environments | Proceed as specified; 30-day view fully supported |
| B      | Prometheus retention is 7 days; longer retention requires separate long-term storage | Reduce Phase 1 to 7-day maximum; add note about long-term storage for compliance needs; may require architectural change for 30-day support |
| C      | Retention varies by environment; support flexible time ranges based on available data | Implement dynamic time range detection; show only available ranges; document retention requirements for customers |
| Custom | Provide specific retention policy information | Please specify actual Prometheus retention policies and any compliance requirements |

**Your choice**: _[Awaiting user response]_

### Question 3: Real-time vs Near-real-time Update Requirements

**Context**: FR-008 specifies 1-minute auto-refresh, and Parker's analysis notes real-time (< 5 seconds) is critical for incident response but has higher infrastructure cost.

**What we need to know**: What latency is acceptable for metric updates during incident response scenarios?

**Suggested Answers**:

| Option | Answer | Implications |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| A      | 1-minute refresh is acceptable for all use cases including incident response | Proceed with 1-minute polling as specified; simpler implementation, lower infrastructure cost |
| B      | Real-time updates (< 5 seconds) are critical for incident response workflows | Requires streaming architecture (WebSockets or Server-Sent Events); adds complexity and infrastructure cost; may extend timeline by 1-2 sprints |
| C      | 1-minute refresh for normal monitoring; manual refresh available for incident response | Keep 1-minute auto-refresh; add manual "Refresh Now" button for immediate updates; balances simplicity and responsiveness |
| Custom | Provide specific latency requirements | Please specify acceptable metric update latency for different use cases |

**Your choice**: _[Awaiting user response]_
