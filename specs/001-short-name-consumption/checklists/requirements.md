# Specification Quality Checklist: Consumption-Based Alerting Mechanism

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [ ] Focused on user value and business needs
- [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [ ] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [ ] Success criteria are measurable
- [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [ ] Edge cases are identified
- [ ] Scope is clearly bounded
- [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [ ] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`

- ✅ All mandatory sections completed
- ✅ Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- ✅ Success criteria are measurable
- ✅ Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)

**Clarifications Needed (3 total):**

1. **FR-005** (line 87): Notification channels - which notification channels are required?
2. **FR-010** (line 92): Consumption metrics - which specific consumption metrics should be monitored?
3. **FR-015** (line 97): Escalation strategy - what escalation strategy is required?

**Status**: Specification quality is high, but requires clarification on 3 critical decisions before proceeding to planning phase.
