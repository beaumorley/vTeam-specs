## Overview

This feature enables proactive monitoring of resource consumption by providing an alerting mechanism that notifies users when consumption metrics approach or exceed defined thresholds. Users can configure alert rules, define thresholds, and receive notifications through their preferred channels to prevent service disruptions, manage costs, and maintain system health.

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

As a system administrator, I need to monitor resource consumption across various services and receive timely alerts when consumption levels become concerning, so I can take proactive action before issues impact users or costs spiral out of control.

When consumption metrics (such as API calls, storage usage, bandwidth, or credits) approach warning thresholds, I receive notifications that give me time to investigate and adjust resources. When critical thresholds are breached, I receive urgent alerts that demand immediate attention.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user has configured an alert rule with warning threshold at 80% and critical threshold at 95%, **When** consumption reaches 82%, **Then** the user receives a warning notification through their configured channel.

2. **Given** multiple alert rules are configured for different consumption metrics, **When** consumption for storage reaches its warning threshold while API usage is normal, **Then** only the storage alert is triggered.

3. **Given** an alert has been triggered, **When** consumption drops below the threshold for a configured period, **Then** the alert automatically resolves and the user receives a resolution notification.

4. **Given** a critical alert has been sent, **When** the user acknowledges the alert, **Then** the system stops sending repeated notifications for that alert instance.

5. **Given** consumption data is being collected, **When** a user creates a new alert rule, **Then** the rule immediately begins monitoring consumption against the defined thresholds.

6. **Given** a user has configured notification preferences, **When** an alert is triggered, **Then** notifications are sent to all configured channels simultaneously.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when consumption rapidly fluctuates around a threshold (e.g., 79%-81%)?
  - System should implement threshold hysteresis to prevent alert flapping

- How does the system handle missing or delayed consumption data?
  - Alert state should reflect data staleness; optionally trigger data availability alerts

- What happens when a notification channel is unavailable or fails?
  - System should attempt delivery through alternate configured channels and log failures

- How are alerts managed when thresholds are adjusted?
  - Active alerts re-evaluate against new thresholds; may auto-resolve or escalate

- What happens to active alerts when an alert rule is deleted?
  - Active alerts should be explicitly closed with notification of rule deletion

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to define alert rules for specific consumption metrics
- **FR-002**: System MUST support multiple threshold levels per alert rule (minimum: warning and critical)
- **FR-003**: System MUST evaluate consumption data against alert rule thresholds in near real-time
- **FR-004**: System MUST trigger notifications when consumption crosses defined thresholds
- **FR-005**: System MUST support multiple notification channels per alert rule [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which notification channels are required - email, SMS, webhooks, in-app, Slack, PagerDuty, or others?]
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to enable and disable alert rules without deleting them
- **FR-007**: System MUST automatically resolve alerts when consumption returns below threshold for a defined duration
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to manually acknowledge alerts to suppress repeated notifications
- **FR-009**: System MUST display current alert status and history for all configured rules
- **FR-010**: System MUST support alert rules for multiple consumption metric types [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: which specific consumption metrics should be monitored - API calls, storage, bandwidth, credits, compute hours, database queries, or others?]
- **FR-011**: Users MUST be able to configure threshold values as percentages or absolute values
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide alert rule templates for common consumption scenarios
- **FR-013**: System MUST prevent alert flapping through configurable hysteresis or cooldown periods
- **FR-014**: System MUST persist alert history for audit and analysis purposes
- **FR-015**: System MUST support notification escalation when alerts remain unacknowledged [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what escalation strategy is required - time-based re-notification, escalation to additional recipients, or different notification channels?]

### Success Criteria

Success criteria must be measurable, technology-agnostic, and focused on user/business outcomes:

1. **Alert Responsiveness**: 95% of alerts are triggered within 2 minutes of threshold breach
2. **User Adoption**: 70% of active users configure at least one alert rule within first month
3. **False Positive Rate**: Less than 5% of triggered alerts are dismissed as false positives
4. **Notification Delivery**: 99% of notifications are successfully delivered to at least one configured channel
5. **User Satisfaction**: 80% of users rate the alerting feature as "useful" or "very useful" in reducing consumption incidents
6. **Incident Prevention**: 60% reduction in consumption-related service disruptions compared to baseline
7. **Time to Resolution**: Average time from alert trigger to issue resolution decreases by 40%

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Alert Rule**: Configuration that defines what consumption metric to monitor, threshold values, notification preferences, and evaluation conditions. Each rule has an enabled/disabled state and links to specific consumption metric sources.

- **Consumption Metric**: Measurement of resource usage over time for a specific resource type (e.g., API calls per hour, storage in GB, bandwidth in TB). Includes current value, historical trend data, and maximum allowed value if applicable.

- **Alert Instance**: Individual occurrence of an alert rule being triggered. Tracks trigger time, threshold breached, current consumption value, acknowledgment status, resolution time, and notification delivery history.

- **Notification Configuration**: User preferences for how and where to receive alerts. Includes channel types, recipient addresses/endpoints, priority filtering, and quiet hours if applicable.

- **Alert History**: Historical record of all alert instances including trigger events, acknowledgments, resolutions, and related consumption data for analysis and compliance.

## Assumptions

The following assumptions are made where the feature description did not specify details:

1. **Notification Channels**: System will support at least email notifications; additional channels (SMS, webhooks, etc.) to be clarified
2. **Consumption Metrics**: System will monitor common resource consumption types; specific metrics to be clarified based on platform capabilities
3. **Real-time Processing**: "Near real-time" defined as alert evaluation within 1-2 minutes of receiving consumption data
4. **Alert Retention**: Alert history will be retained for minimum 90 days for audit purposes
5. **User Permissions**: Users can only configure alerts for resources they have permission to monitor
6. **Threshold Flexibility**: Both percentage-based and absolute value thresholds supported to accommodate different use cases
7. **Multi-tenancy**: Alert rules and notifications are isolated per user/organization
8. **Escalation Default**: If not configured, alerts will re-notify at defined intervals (e.g., every 4 hours for critical alerts)

## Dependencies

- Access to consumption metric data sources or monitoring systems
- Notification delivery infrastructure for supported channels
- User authentication and authorization system for managing alert rules
- Time-series data storage for consumption history and alert trending

## Out of Scope

The following items are explicitly excluded from this feature:

1. Predictive alerting based on consumption trend forecasting
2. Automated remediation actions triggered by alerts
3. Cost calculation or billing integration (alerts on consumption only, not costs)
4. Custom metric aggregation or transformation
5. Alert correlation across multiple metric types
6. External monitoring system integration (beyond consumption metrics within the platform)
7. Mobile application for alert management
