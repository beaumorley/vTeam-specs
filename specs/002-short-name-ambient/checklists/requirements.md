# Specification Quality Checklist: Ambient Alert Mechanism

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-23
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- **Status**: Spec quality is excellent, but 3 clarification markers remain (FR-016, FR-017, FR-018)
- **Next Steps**: User must provide answers for the 3 clarification questions before proceeding to `/speckit.plan`
- **Clarifications Needed**:
  1. FR-016: Alert template customization level
  2. FR-017: Digest mode support and frequency
  3. FR-018: Alert escalation behavior
