## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

## Overview

The Ambient Alert Mechanism enables users to receive timely notifications about important events, status changes, or conditions that require their attention. This feature provides a flexible alerting system that delivers notifications to consumers through configurable channels based on their preferences and the urgency of the information.

### Business Value

**Why this matters**: Users need to stay informed about critical events without constantly monitoring systems. Alerts enable proactive responses to issues, reduce response times, and ensure important information reaches the right people at the right time.

## Success Criteria

The feature will be considered successful when:

1. **Delivery Performance**: 95% of alerts are delivered within 5 seconds of the triggering event
2. **User Engagement**: At least 70% of users configure at least one alert preference within their first week
3. **Actionability**: 80% of high-priority alerts result in user action within 15 minutes
4. **Notification Accuracy**: False positive rate remains below 5% for all alert types
5. **User Satisfaction**: Post-deployment survey shows 80%+ satisfaction with alert relevance and timing
6. **Completion Rate**: Users can successfully configure an alert from start to finish in under 2 minutes

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a system user, I need to receive timely notifications about events that matter to me, so I can respond quickly to important situations without constantly monitoring the system. I want to customize which alerts I receive, how I receive them, and when they should notify me based on my availability and preferences.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a user has configured email alerts for high-priority events, **When** a high-priority event occurs, **Then** the user receives an email notification within 5 seconds containing relevant event details

2. **Given** a user has set quiet hours from 10 PM to 7 AM, **When** a low-priority alert is triggered at 11 PM, **Then** the alert is queued and delivered at 7 AM

3. **Given** a user receives an alert notification, **When** the user clicks on the alert, **Then** they are directed to the relevant system area with context about the triggering event

4. **Given** multiple alerts are triggered within a short time window, **When** alerts are sent to the user, **Then** related alerts are grouped together to prevent notification fatigue

5. **Given** an alert delivery fails, **When** the system detects the failure, **Then** it attempts delivery through an alternative configured channel

6. **Given** a user wants to pause all alerts temporarily, **When** they enable "do not disturb" mode, **Then** all non-critical alerts are suppressed until they disable the mode

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user has no configured notification channels?
  - System should prompt user to configure at least one channel before enabling alerts

- What happens when an alert is triggered but the event condition is resolved before delivery?
  - System should check event status immediately before delivery and suppress resolved alerts

- What happens when a user receives duplicate alerts for the same event?
  - System should implement deduplication logic to prevent multiple notifications for identical events within a defined time window (e.g., 5 minutes)

- What happens when system is processing thousands of alerts simultaneously?
  - System should maintain delivery performance targets through prioritization (critical alerts first) and efficient queuing

- What happens when a user is unreachable through all configured channels?
  - System should log failed delivery attempts and provide a notification history where users can review missed alerts

## Requirements

### Assumptions

- Users have valid contact information (email, phone) for notification delivery
- Industry-standard notification delivery is email, SMS, and in-app notifications
- Standard data retention for alert history is 90 days unless specified otherwise
- Alert prioritization follows common patterns: Critical, High, Medium, Low
- Users prefer to receive grouped notifications rather than individual alerts when multiple events occur in quick succession
- Business hours default to 9 AM - 5 PM local time unless customized
- Mobile push notifications require users to have installed the associated application

### Dependencies

- User authentication system must be in place to associate alerts with specific users
- Event system or monitoring infrastructure must be capable of triggering alerts
- User profile system must store notification preferences and contact information
- Time zone data must be available to respect user local time for quiet hours

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to subscribe to specific alert categories or event types
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to configure notification delivery channels (email, SMS, in-app)
- **FR-003**: System MUST allow users to set notification preferences including priority thresholds and quiet hours
- **FR-004**: System MUST deliver alerts within 5 seconds for critical and high-priority events
- **FR-005**: System MUST include relevant context in alert notifications (event details, timestamp, affected resources)
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide a notification history where users can review past alerts
- **FR-007**: System MUST support alert grouping to combine related notifications within a configurable time window
- **FR-008**: System MUST respect user-defined quiet hours by deferring non-critical alerts
- **FR-009**: System MUST allow users to acknowledge or dismiss alerts
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide a "do not disturb" mode to temporarily suppress non-critical notifications
- **FR-011**: System MUST attempt delivery through alternative channels when primary channel fails
- **FR-012**: System MUST deduplicate identical alerts within a 5-minute window
- **FR-013**: System MUST allow users to enable or disable alerts globally or per category
- **FR-014**: System MUST provide clear opt-in/opt-out mechanisms for each alert type
- **FR-015**: System MUST support alert priority levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)
- **FR-016**: System MUST allow users to customize alert content templates [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What level of customization - simple text substitution or full template control?]
- **FR-017**: System MUST support digest mode [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should users be able to receive batched summaries instead of real-time alerts, and at what frequency?]
- **FR-018**: System MUST handle alert escalation [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should unacknowledged critical alerts escalate to additional recipients or channels after a time threshold?]

### Key Entities

- **Alert**: Represents a notification event with properties including alert type, priority level, triggering event details, timestamp, target recipients, and delivery status

- **Alert Subscription**: Links users to specific alert categories with properties including user identifier, alert category, enabled status, and custom filters

- **Notification Preference**: User-specific settings including preferred delivery channels, quiet hours schedule, priority thresholds, digest preferences, and do-not-disturb status

- **Alert History**: Record of sent alerts including delivery timestamp, delivery channel, delivery status, acknowledgment status, and user interactions

- **Alert Category**: Classification of alert types including category name, default priority level, description, and available customization options

## Out of Scope

The following are explicitly excluded from this feature:

- **Two-way communication**: Users cannot respond to alerts or take actions directly within notification messages (e.g., no "approve/reject" buttons in emails)
- **External integrations**: No integrations with third-party services like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or PagerDuty in initial release
- **Voice calls**: Audio/voice notification channels are not included
- **Alert forecasting**: No predictive analytics or machine learning to anticipate future alerts
- **Alert workflow automation**: No ability to trigger automated responses or workflows based on alert conditions
- **Multi-language support**: All notifications will be in English only for initial release
- **Rich media**: No images, videos, or interactive elements in notifications
